                    beach, you can rent a tube and go down into the sea. In that case, the tube fare is Tk 40 per hour.
                    You
                    can also go to the sea by water boat/speed boat. The cost will be 300–400 taka (two rounds). You can
                    also drink coconut water to relieve fatigue. The price is 40–50 taka.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Sugandha Point-
                <p>
                    This is the most popular point, so So everyone crowds here. Here is the popular Burmese market. You
                    can enjoy a bike ride on the beach if you want. The cost will be 200 takas-1.5 km and 300 takas-2.5

                Laboni Point-

                    better not to stay here after the evening.</p>
